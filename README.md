## Projects:
#### Pokemon App (Single Page Application)
I developed a Single Page Application (SPA) called Pokemon App. The project utilized React and Redux for the Front-End, while the Back-End was built with Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. All the styling was implemented using CSS.

Functionality:
* **Filter**: Implemented a filter option to sort Pokemon by their types. ✔️
* **Order**: Added functionality to sort Pokemon alphabetically and by strength. ✔️
* **Search**: Implemented a search feature that allows users to find Pokemon by their names. ✔️
* **Pokemon Detail**: Displayed detailed information about each Pokemon. ✔️
* **Create New Pokemon**: Enabled the creation of new Pokemon within the application. ✔️

## Language and tools:
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* HTML
